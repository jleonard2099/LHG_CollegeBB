College BB has "no shot clock" option
Pro BB does not

The most likely reason is that College BB waited 20 years
But Pro BB didn't have a shot clock before 1950

When manually scheduling games the last thing you need to do is change date and time. 
If you do it first. Then enter the teams it reverts back to original

Also on Tournament. 
If you set up a region then save it and move to next region you have to select year again. 
It doesnâ€™t remember by just hitting enter.
