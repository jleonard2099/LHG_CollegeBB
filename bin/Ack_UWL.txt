The text editor used for viewing and modifying box scores is a stripped-down 
version of QB-Write from what was once UnderWARE Labs. Other aliases for this 
creator are as follows:
- Lester Schramm
- Steelcharm
- UWLabs

The modified code for the editor is technically not to be distributed per it's
original agreement terms from the 80's. To date, I have not been able to find 
contact information for this author to ask for formal permission to distribute 
the code. The author was briefly active at some BASIC forums in 2008. At the 
time, it appears downloads of all his programs were still being offered but the
website was being retired. I would suspect and/or anticipate his approval of me
using a modified version of his code for purposes it serves in these games 
(the original editor used relied heavily on custom assembly routines and code).

Given that I have no other solution to fit my very specific needs, I felt it 
respectful and prudent to at least credit the author since, I intend to include 
the code and rely on it for this effort. I kindly ask if there is any way to 
contact the author, please let me know at support@lhgames.net. I am willing to 
support the work in any way that would seem fit, eventhough it does not seem 
the individual profits from it to this day.
